# hedron-hologram
I'm coding a music visualizer for pyramid hologram viewers. Used tools are Unity3D (stage setup, model control) and Photoshop (heavy lifter for Unity3D's textures and shaders).

Some rendered videos are here: http://bit.ly/2vSahYZ

The current active scene is four-sided view, which is different than the version you found in those videos (four identical sides). Since I found that most of the tutorials on how to make a hologram viewer tend to make the hologram positioned in the center which is not beneficial for four-sided view, I will look further into this very soon. So stay tune then. 

Mobile app is coming soon!
